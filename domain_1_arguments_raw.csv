1487	And that pseudo-scientific argument — that an embryo is a person because it contains the DNA of a potential person — is true of any human cell , and certainly true of the countless fertilized eggs that , in the natural course of reproduction , are destroyed before they can develop .	argument
1488	Cases where complications in the pregnancy lead to significantly higher risk to the woman ’s life are more frequent than we wish they would be .	argument
1489	The second virtue of Pollitt ’s book is that — with the help of some arguments from the late Ronald Dworkin , in particular — it takes seriously , and seriously refutes , the metaphysical arguments that claim some ethical seriousness in the view that a fertilized egg is equivalent to a human being .	argument

1496	Anyone who even thinks about having an abortion is mentally messed up because that is killing someone 's life that could happen .	argument
1497	Abortion has killed about 56 million PEOPLE !	argument
1498	According to a global study collaboratively conducted by the World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute , most unsafe abortions occur where abortion is illegal .	argument
1499	For women who demand complete control of their body , control should include preventing the risk of unwanted pregnancy through the responsible use of contraception or , if that is not possible , through abstinence .	argument
1500	If you ca n't accept infanticide , you must oppose abortion .	argument
1501	Each person has the fundamental right to life and all that it entails .	argument
1502	These alternatives not only avoid the ethical problems inherent in using human embryos but have also been more successful to date .	argument

1508	Cloning can help save lives .	argument
1509	Since the embryo was a genetic duplicate of the patient , there would be no immunological rejection .	argument
1510	Religious and other opponents of this technology are saying that this process disrupts nature because procreation is something that should n’t be tampered with .	argument

1512	( c ) Cloning would constitute an infringement of human dignity , that is a cloned child could be a means to an end .	argument
1513	Some cloning advocates argue that cloning-to-produce-children might follow the same path as IVF , skipping from ethically unacceptable experimentation to a widely accepted practice .	argument
1514	But if someone is dying and needs an organ , and they choose to clone an organ of theirs or they already have a clone of themselves completely healthy , then HELL , it 's saving them !	argument
1515	Of course the cons to therapeutic cloning is how much it costs , but this debate is more about ethics than anything else , and killing a human embryo to save a life IS ethical .	argument
1516	Moreover , advocates of this objection caution against removing God from the process of creation altogether , which , it is argued , is what reproductive cloning achieves ( Rikfin , 2000 ) .	argument
1517	A cloned human being 's family , for example , is unlikely ever to see him as the original .	argument
1518	"Jesse Rainbow explain why there is an aversion to human cloning - a clone would not be a "" real person "" - cloning is "" playing the God "" - cloning is not "" natural "" mention in closing some of the conditions proposed in a provisional list yet , so research on therapeutic human cloning ( reproductive one is illegal ) to proceed lawfully : it is necessary for embryos to be used only in the early stages of their development , without being allowed to grow further , all programs research must be supervised by government organizations dealing with fertilization and genetic techniques , various research programs will receive funding and approval only if it is scientifically demonstrated that there is no other way of obtaining the same results conventional , will not be permitted to research on human genetic material can be combined with that of animals , there must be a permanent state of public information on research undertaken and to be postulated that the limitations may be required to report the experiences and suffering of animals used for human benefit ."	argument
1519	( e ) Cloning would undermine individuality and identity .	argument
1520	For those who do not believe that life is sacred , it is just tissue being disposed of .	argument
1521	It is unethical to experiment on an embryo for the same reason it is unethical to experiment on any human being and since embryo experimentation often results in the destruction of the embryo , this equates to murdering the embryo ( Deckers , 2007 ; Oduncu , 2003 ; Novak , 2001 ) .	argument
1522	And it is vastly more practical to have a child within the context of marriage and a family than in a laboratory .	argument

1526	We also could save endangered species , even revive extinct ones .	argument
1527	Intentionally taking steps to create a child via cloning ( or any other kind of reproductive technology ) could be seen , instead , as a mutual affirmation of love on behalf of the prospective parents and clear evidence that they really desired the resulting child .	argument

1533	"Reproductive cloning would entail dehumanizing experimentation "" Just Say No To Human Cloning "" ."	argument
1534	Permitting cloning , therefore , would allow for a more expedient means of creating a savior sibling , since the alternatives ( using preimplantation genetic diagnosis to screen embryos to determine which are genetically compatible with the sibling , implanting into a womb only the ones that are a match and discarding the others , or creating an embryo through natural reproduction and terminating the pregnancy if it is not a genetic match ) are more involved and more time consuming .	argument
1535	Cloning , they claim , is a better technology for harvesting stem cells because it could mitigate problems of tissue rejection , since stem cells are cloned from the patient 's own body .	argument

1551	Cloning has the potential to change the world for infertile couples almost overnight .	argument
1552	Even if the scientist had been able to find gamete donors to give free and informed consent to exposing their genetic offspring to such risks , the proper response would not be to conclude that , having obtained the consent of the relevant parties , the scientist conducted the study ethically .	argument
1553	I agree that cloning is not a good thing .	argument
1554	Absent other external factors ( such as social or parental expectations ) , an individual 's autonomy is not compromised solely because he/she does not have a unique genome .	argument
1555	In a free society , people have the right to pursue any scientific-and especially medical-investigation .	argument

1559	Human cloning still has a lot of what ifs associated with it .	argument
1560	Innovation That Can Change the World Cloning is innovation that is extremely powerful and has the ability to bring about huge change .	argument
1561	"also two gay women could use this technology to conceive a child of their own using their individual 23 chromosomes . """	argument
1562	I view this like I view abortion , the embryo is not a person yet , not technically .	argument
1563	Human cloning violates the dignity and respect due to every human individual as it undermines the rights , identity and welfare of any child created in this way .	argument
1564	The most straightforward scenarios in which cloning could be used to prevent genetic disease involve what are called simple genetic diseases , or diseases that are caused by mutations in single genes and are passed on in accordance with the basic Mendelian rules of inheritance .	argument
1565	An ethical argument that is often put forward by scientists but seldom developed in more detail focuses on health risks in animal cloning .	argument
1566	If genes are modified to create smarter being those that are average will not have a place in society .	argument
1567	However , if a virus is used as a reprogramming factor , it may activate oncogenes , which are cancer-causing genes .	argument
1568	In a sense , this objection maintains that a cloned child would either lack the free will to live her life according to her own desire and goals or that , at the very least , her free will would be severely restricted by her parents or the society that has certain expectations of her given her genetic lineage .	argument
1569	For example cloning can be used to get more hair from a few sample hair follicles or grafts from the patient 's head and then grow them .... later transplant the grafts where it is needed .	argument
1570	And it would allow gay men to have children without the use of donor eggs and a suragette .	argument
1571	This is the best invention and we need to go with it .	argument
1572	From a more liberal standpoint , Mr Fukuyama worries about equality if inequality is designed into people 's genes .	argument
1573	"Another scientific argument is that genetic diversity helps provide the "" pool "" of variations available for a robust human population ."	argument
1574	It could also help humans adapt to the growing problems of , for instance , global warming in the world .	argument
1575	Also , it could create new societal division , where perfect clones would be treated in a different way than those who are naturally born .	argument
1576	The process of transplanting human organs can become simpler , with an immensely improved success rate .	argument
1577	( While in most cases , the idea of cloning a dictator like Hitler is invoked as a criticism of eugenic schemes , some writers have actually advocated the selective eugenic propagation of tyrants — for instance , the American geneticist Hermann J. Muller who , in a 1936 letter to Stalin advocating the eugenic use of artificial insemination , named Lenin as an example of a source of genetic material whose outstanding worth “ virtually all would gladly recognize . ”	argument
1578	Ian Wilmut , Dolly ’s creator , has denounced human reproductive cloning as too dangerous to attempt ( Travis , 2001 ) .	argument
1579	There are powerful leaders in every generation who will seek to abuse this technology for their own purposes .	argument
1580	Presently , it is far more expensive to clone than to reproduce animals by other means .	argument
1581	Roughly one in five feel cloning would be justified either to save the life of the person being cloned , or to help infertile couples to have children without having to adopt .	argument
1582	"Individualism will be maintained despite cloning , as "" clones "" will develop their own unique identities : Children produced by reproductive cloning will be ‘ clones ’ but not ‘ copies ’ of their parents : Different environmental factors , nurture , and the process of gestation mean that children will not be emotionally or mentally identical to the people from whom they are cloned ."	argument
1583	If cloning an existing person is acceptable here , this counterexample shows there is no valid dignity argument against cloning .	argument
1584	Although SCNT is used to create embryos for therapeutic cloning , there is no intent to implant them in order to create children .	argument
1585	Whereas in sexual reproduction the child may be a product of chance , a cloned child would be a product of deliberate choice , which , according to some philosophers , could be a superior method of creation in some respects ( Buchanan et al. 2000 ) .	argument
1586	The child ’s very desire to be different from her predecessor illustrates that she is not destined to be like her predecessor .	argument
1587	The practice is legal in other countries .	argument
1588	( 4 ) What is harder is that it could reach the reproduction of living people without them knowing , to be involved in this process or to give consent .	argument
1589	Having a clone may be beneficial at one point , but if there is more of you , potential loss of individuality is highly likely .	argument
1590	In addition , anything that thwarts the natural process of conception ( i.e. , birth control ) may also be morally condemned .	argument
1591	Trying to treat a mitochondrial disease by turning back the clock on an adult cell 's genome would do nothing , because the messed-up mitochondrial DNA remains in the iPS cell .	argument
1592	People who have strong religious beliefs generally oppose the process of cloning humans , as they feel that it would result in man becoming the creator , changing the authority of a supreme being .	argument
1593	Some critics worry about a larger social effect , or even an effect on our species , if cloning restricted the diversity of children being born ( perhaps because parents and doctors might look for donors with a narrow range of characteristics , such as possessing high intelligence and meeting certain standards of physical beauty ) .	argument
1594	Those that survive will have genetic abnormalities , one of which is rapid aging .	argument
1595	For reproductive cloning , this could mean being as safe as IVF technology for example .	argument
1596	""" As the technology advances , I think the legal and ethical and political dialogue should also go along with it , so we can face these potential future issues in a proactive kind of way , "" he said ."	argument
1597	For example , the February 19 , 2001 cover shows two mirror image infants staring at each other , the tagline suggesting that cloning may be used by grieving parents who wish to resurrect their dead child .	argument
1598	They said that this form of interference is decidedly wrong and can lead to a domino effect , which means that other attributes of life could be changed or altered negatively as a result .	argument
1599	That ’s a good pragmatic reason not to make attempts until we know a lot more , and even then we ’d need to have developed the technology to a point where we are about as likely as with ordinary births to end up with a healthy baby .	argument
1600	It was an inconceivable paradox that proponents of therapeutic cloning would sacrifice the life of one in order to serve another .	argument
1601	Because cloning involves the artificial process of recreating a pre-existing genetic code , prospective parents could , first , choose their child ’s DNA ( thereby creating a “ designer child ” ) , and , second , because they are creating a “ replica ” of an existing person , they will consider the child more akin to property than an individual in her own right .	argument
1602	The available scientific evidence indicates that many or most children created through cloning would suffer from medical problems as a result of the procedure used to create them .	argument
1603	they are murdering the next generation !!!!	argument
1604	That means that consumers who oppose animal cloning on animal welfare , religious , or moral grounds would be forced to unwittingly make purchases that violate their ethical principles .	argument
1605	Before we embark on asexual reproduction in order deliberately to select our offspring ’s genes , we would do well to remember that sexual reproduction has been the way of our ancestors for over a billion years , and has been essential for the flourishing of the diverse forms of multicellular life on earth .	argument
1606	Many believe that cloning is against God ’s wishes because the clones would be created by man .	argument
1607	This would then create premature aging issues and potentially even premature death , all because of the cloning process .	argument
1608	Childless couples would be able to use cloning technology , and for many of them this may be preferable to IVF or surrogacy arrangements .	argument
1609	India remained totally opposed to reproductive cloning owing to the doubtful nature of its safety , success , utility and ethical acceptability , he said .	argument
1610	It risks the possibility of faster aging .	argument
1611	There are other serious moral problems associated with cloning-for-biomedical-research , including the exploitation of women who will be needed to provide eggs .	argument
1612	"Every time a clone is made it is like throwing the dice and even a string of "" healthy "" clones being born would not change the likelihood that many clones born in future may have severe medical problems ."	argument
1613	Thus , when it comes to creating a clone of an existing child , Robertson avers that the first child “ may have no right to determine whether or not she is cloned , ” since the child is not herself “ reproducing directly ” — rather , it is her parents who are reproducing by creating a “ later-born identical twin . ”	argument
1614	Equally important , RESOLVE and its CAMR partners oppose any effort that would allow reproductive cloning , a technique we believe , at this time , is unsafe , irresponsible and unethical .	argument
1615	Ms Landrieu does not want to ban cloning research in order to limit medical knowledge .	argument
1616	A fertilized egg should be valued as a human life even if it is in its very first weeks .	argument
1617	One argument in favor of artificial embryo twinning is that it provides an infertile couple , who may not have been able to produce many viable embryos through IVF , with more embryos that they can then implant for an increased chance at successful reproduction ( Robertson , 1994 ) .	argument
1618	Others feel that the idea of cloning humans is “ playing God . ”	argument
1619	Ninety-five percent of cloning done have failed in the form of miscarriages , stillbirths and other life-threatening events .	argument
1620	In the upshot , human reproductive cloning is not yet feasible , and indeed there ’s no current prospect that it could be carried out effectively and safely in the foreseeable future .	argument
1621	The appeal of this understanding of the family surely helps explain why most Americans find the idea of human cloning morally repugnant .	argument
1622	Supporters of therapeutic cloning technologies believe that efforts to ban bio-medical research could have an adverse effect for many Americans who hope for access to cures from many diseases .	argument
1623	so i dont think we should make the mistake and go and mess around with nature .	argument
1624	Cloned human beings may not be considered humans by other people .	argument
1625	However , there is no evidence that identical multiples feel this way , and there does not seem to be anything inherent about sharing a genetic code that compromises individuality ( Elliot , 1998 ) .	argument
1626	Therefore , if parents are not prohibited from procreating on the grounds that they may pass along a severe genetic defect to their children , then it is difficult to deny a set of parents who can only rely on cloning for procreation the chance to do so based on safety reasons alone ( unless the abnormalities that may result from cloning are more severe than the abnormalities that may result from natural conception ) ( Brock , 1997 ) .	argument
1627	"[ 35 , 36 ] As summarized by Deirk Ullrich in relation to law in Canada and Germany : "" human dignity is an indispensable compass in our continuing journey to promote and protect the rights and freedoms of the individual "" ."	argument
1628	"God made "" humans "" in his "" image "" ( pay attention to the quotation marks ) , he did n't make other gods ."	argument
1629	Even if a clone were to appear healthy at birth , there are concerns about health problems arising later in life .	argument
1630	The availability of morally acceptable alternatives makes cloning-for-biomedical-research less justifiable .	argument
1631	Curing Disorders Human cloning also has the potential to help cure certain disorders .	argument
1632	Therapeutic cloning is not just a remedy but also a preventive treatment .	argument
1633	At the very least , the argument concludes , SCNT should be allowed for research and therapeutic purposes ( Devolder and Savulescu , 2006 ; American Medical Association , 2003 ; Maas , 2001 ) .	argument
1634	In other words , “ unnatural ” is not synonymous with “ immoral ” ( and conversely , “ natural ” is not synonymous with “ moral ” ) .	argument
1635	Reproductive cloning is considered wrong in so many levels .	argument
1636	Today , parents with children affected by diseases like these may use IVF and PGD to have a child whose cord blood will be a match for their sick child , since one in four siblings will have compatible bone marrow and cord blood .	argument
1637	If we can play our cards right , cloning might actually be a good thing .	argument
1638	Many attempts at animal cloning produced disfigured monsters with severe abnormalities .	argument
1639	Third , the technique could be used to create “ enhanced ” children by cloning an individual considered excellent in some way .	argument
1640	Learning the process of reprogramming , differentiation , and dedifferentiation is likely to result in just as many medical miracles as stem cell research .	argument
1641	Cellular models of diseases can be developed as well , along with the ability to test drug efficacy : “ cloning a single skin cell from a patient with a disease could be used to produce inexhaustible amounts of cells and tissue with that disease .	argument
1642	Humans should be created through an act of love and not an act of science .	argument
1643	The first uses of bone marrow transplantation to treat chronic myeloid leukemia involved identical twins , but doctors soon discovered that siblings , or even unrelated donors with identical human leukocyte antigens , could also provide bone marrow .	argument

1646	Indeed , Dolly 's death , while not definitively traceable to the cloning process , again highlighted the possible health risks associated with reproductive cloning .	argument
1647	This sign of love is lost when a child ’s life begins in a laboratory .	argument
1648	Cloning children could foster an understanding that children can be designed and replicated to the parents ’ wishes .	argument
1649	The animals that would be brought back would likely be carrying viruses and illnesses that we are not immune to , or prepared to deal with .	argument
1650	Of course , selecting the genome of a child is not a fully reliable way of determining the child ’s biological traits or properties , but it represents an unprecedented level of control : by creating a child with only one genetic parent , cloning allows for exact determination of a child ’s lineage .	argument
1651	BWS entails a larger-than-usual growth pattern and a range of health risks and physical abnormalities .	argument
1652	Proposed therapeutic uses of cloning techniques would entail many millions of women 's eggs a year , a quantity that seems prohibitively large .	argument
1653	Furthermore , there are too many people on this planet now to even consider the vast population increases you are fantasizing about .	argument
1654	Law professor Kerry Lynn Macintosh , in a recent pro-cloning book , exhibits a sound grasp of the science of human cloning and genetics , and rightly argues that two people who share the same DNA will not possess “ the same intellectual , psychological , or behavioral traits . ”	argument

1656	The current options for infertile couples are painful , expensive , and heart-breaking .	argument
1657	Cloning is such a huge ethical and moral concern .	argument
1658	Norway ’s representative said that his Government opposed both reproductive human cloning and therapeutic cloning , as reflected in its domestic legislation .	argument
1659	Because doctors or scientists are given the power to change a person ’s genetic makeup , it could also mean that mistakes can be made .	argument
1660	Even if a cloned child is not told of his origins , parents will , in the act of specifying their child ’s entire genome , be exercising control over their child ’s origins and identity that will shape the expectations they have for the child that could distort their own openness to the child ’s developing autonomy and aspirations .	argument
1661	As we discussed above , there are serious concerns that the use of cloning technology will result in medically harmful side effects for children , but the chief problem with the idea of transforming reproduction into a manufacturing process is not that this will result in the children being “ flawed . ”	argument
1662	There are no medical reasons for eating chocolates , driving cars , using IVF technology or adopting children , but none of these are prohibited .	argument
1663	The genetic engineering field is infamous for some of the unintended and unforeseen effects of genetic modification , such as the Bt corn ’s harmful effects on the Monarch butterfly .	argument

1673	Many opponents fear that the cloning technology could be abused by people with vested interests .	argument
1674	The implications of what happens when human cloning goes wrong are not fully understood , which is not ideal .	argument
1675	Personally , I see nothing wrong with cloning , as long as it 's used in the right parameters .	argument
1676	Just as each member of a pair of identical twins has a soul , so would a clone .	argument
1677	Moreover , even if there were a detriment , it is unclear whether that would be a result of society ’s prejudice and fear of human cloning , or a result that inherently comes with being a clone .	argument
1678	Reproductive cloning helps people fulfill their dreams of having children .	argument
1679	Rarely do domestic or international instruments provide an operational definition of human dignity and there is rarely an explanation of how , exactly , dignity is infringed in the context reproductive cloning .	argument
1680	Clones could be seen as less than human compared with non-clones .	argument
1681	The technique is extremely risky right now .	argument
1682	Whatever improvements might someday be made in the safety of animal cloning , the high variability between the health outcomes of cloned animals of different species means that the safety of cloning-to-produce-children will initially be unknowable .	argument
1683	The study showed that scientists could reproduce work published last year by researchers in Oregon who used skin cells from a patient to create a cloned embryo and from the cloned embryos derived embryonic stem cells .	argument

1687	The science of human cloning is not well known as of right now .	argument
1688	The other foetuses were hideously deformed and either died or were aborted .	argument
1689	Creating a child for the sole purpose of saving another child violates the formula of humanity because the child is created specifically for this end .	argument
1690	However , the main difference is that the birth of human twins is seen as a natural practice , but human cloning is seen as artificial in nature .	argument
1691	"As noted by Pattinson , the act of cloning could be implicated in an intention to "" violate the rights of the clone in the future . """	argument
1692	Rather , it is aimed at “ ending reproductive roulette , ” or progressing from “ chance to choice ” or from “ chance to purpose , ” to borrow from the titles of three books .	argument

1917	Because the sick will demand it - Those resisting human cloning research will probably find themselves shouted down by the sick and the maimed who desperately need such research .	argument
1918	Gene therapy is available only to the very rich and elite , which means that traits that tend to make people earn less money would eventually die out .	argument
1919	If disposal of defective clones will be as easy as creating human copies , having clones made will be similar to buying stuff at the supermarket .	argument
1920	Revived attempts to turn cloning into a commercial business are little more than money-making schemes designed to take advantage of pet lovers at the expense of animals .	argument

1922	The existence of a cloned person , therefore , could be mutually beneficial , rather than asymmetrical ) .	argument
1923	Human cloning is unethical because we can not know the results , because alters societal roles , and because it degrades humanity .	argument
1924	It is likely that the anti-cloners are quite wrong .	argument
1925	Furthermore , while improvements in technology may reduce the risks associated with cloning , using cells from exceptionally long-lived individuals to select for genes disposing to health and longevity may pose its own risks .	argument
1926	It can also bring about the recreation of species that have long since died , allowing scientists to fully study the species as a living creature instead of simply looking at images or bones .	argument
1927	All the people that say it is a lack of human respect and thinking thescientist will look at themselves as Co-creators , is all a shame .	argument
1928	Human cloning and genetic engineering In addition to concerns about animal welfare , many worry that the technology used to clone animals is the same that can be used to clone humans or produce transgenic animals , but the implications of such applications have yet to be fully examined .	argument
1929	Human cloning may cause people to age faster because entropy may be inputted into the life of a cell being cloned .	argument

1938	"Dworkin puts it in less secular terms : "" It is wrong , people say , particularly after more familiar objections have been found wanting , to play God "" ."	argument
1939	Those who want to have twins will also be able to make that wish come true .	argument
1940	It would violate the widely held convictions concerning human individuality and freedom , and could lead to devaluation of clones in comparison with non-clones .	argument
1941	Socially , the possibility of bringing forth another human being that is the exact copy of another human being , blurs the definition and scope of individual rights , because these human clones , if brought to term , will never be like any other human being with a proper lineage , nor would the clone be anyone ’s child , grandchild or sibling , but he or she would only be , scientifically , someone ’s clone .	argument
1942	Genes that are defective could be eliminated , which may eliminate the genetic diseases that defective genes may cause .	argument
1943	Candidates for this distinction often include Mozart and Einstein , though the legacy of eugenics in the twentieth century has left many authors with an awareness that those who would use these technologies may be more interested in replicating men like Hitler .	argument
1944	Cloning in the plant realm occurs naturally .	argument
1945	You can not simply stop people from having children if they suffer from a disease like this , therefore genetic engineering can help to ensure that their children live long and healthy lives from either the disease itself or from carrying the disease to pass on to younger generations .	argument

1952	Reproductive cloning might lead to a whole set of problems that we have not been equipped yet .	argument
1953	Second , even if such confusion did result , it is questionable whether it would be any more detrimental to the child than any confusion that currently exists about parental roles given certain reproductive technologies .	argument

1960	Genetic PoV : Sure , creating some super plant or animal sounds like a good idea now but when looked at over the years , it can be very risky .	argument
1961	Often clones do n't live as long as sexually reproduced animals , possibly because the genes taken from adults are more likely to have undergone mutations .	argument
1962	But even if cloning offers some advantages over iPS cells , the availability of a comparable alternative weakens the case for permitting cloning .	argument
1963	There would be no fear of ‘ accidental cloning ’ that could bring a child to a parent who was unprepared , or unwilling , to love it .	argument

1972	The greatest support , 28 % , was for the production of copies of vital human organs to help save lives .	argument
1973	However , it is the pressure or social expectations ( expectations that are necessarily informed by an inaccurate view of the role of genes ) placed on the individual clone that challenge the clone 's human dignity , not the process of reproductive cloning .	argument
1974	Creating a child via cloning does not entail that there is a lack of mutual love between the parents , or that the resulting child would be any less loved ( Strong , 1998 ) .	argument
1975	It is not horrid and blood crazy like it sounds ( thank you movies ) .	argument
1976	"As things were headed becoming better by the appearance of a human clone , a major problem has become "" human cloning prohibition act "" in 2009 , which has labeled as cloning illegal , immoral , not unethical activity ."	argument
1977	If such parents are not deprived of their opportunity to have children out of concern that they will violate their child ’s right to an open future , then we seem hard pressed to find a reason to deprive couples who would turn to cloning for reproductive purposes of a similar opportunity .	argument
1978	Surely the process used to produce an individual is completely irrelevant to the respect and dignity the individual deserves once born .	argument
1979	It is speculated that human cloning could eventually be used as a means to exploit people for other people ’s vested interests .	argument
1980	If someone has a failing heart they can reproduce them .	argument
1981	It is not always easy to find an exact match , be it blood group or other compatibility factors .	argument
1982	These factors will contribute to viewing and treating the child as a mere commodity .	argument

1990	The U.K. government has recently accepted recommendations from its chief medical to permit research using embryos subject to controls , which include a 14-day limit ( see the Department of Health website listed below in ï ¿ ½ learn moreï ¿ ½ ) .	argument
1991	For all that , you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to resemble the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems .	argument
1992	I agree with cloning can save us , think of all the abnormalities humans have these days , and cancers , diseases etc .	argument
1993	This also has the potential to alter the way health problems are treated .	argument

2009	With genetic engineering we can design foods that are better able to withstand harsh temperatures – such as the very hot or very cold , for instance – and that are packed full of all the right nutrients that humans and animals need to survive .	argument
2010	This means that the process of human organ transplantation can become simplified and the success rate can be improved immensely .	argument
2011	Rare animals might be saved from extinction , especially those animals that do not reproduce well in changing environmental circumstances .	argument
2012	As for spare parts , it would be no more ethical to use a clone for that purpose than it would be to use your next door neighbor .	argument

2016	The most important part of a person is their spirit , soul or mind and cloning does not allow one to achieve this , it rather allows one to attempt to achieve some genetic standard .	argument
2017	Moreover , the findings of the study supported the thesis that “ genetic ties are less important for family functioning than a strong desire for parenthood ” ( Golombok et al. , 1995 , 296 ) , which suggests that the parents of cloned children would not be as caught up with the genetic origins of their offspring , and so their parenting would not be as affected by it , as Meilaender contends .	argument
2018	Among these is the possibility of cloning parts of humans , like vital organs to be used in transplants , which would be likely to nullify organ rejection issues .	argument
2019	One response to the “ unnatural ” objection is similar to the first response to the “ playing God ” objection ; most everything humans do , from medicine to modern forms of sanitation , are “ unnatural ” , and most are not considered morally objectionable as a consequence .	argument
2020	Cloning a human is a very personal and emotional decision , but that does n't mean cloning itself is an abomination .	argument
2021	Cloning is a break from the natural process of evolution , which is known to strengthen species and improves their survival instincts through diversity .	argument
2022	However , since the product of human cloning is a human embryo , using cloning to produce tissues or organs directly rather than producing “ an entire individual ” ignores the fact that the product of human cloning already is “ an entire individual , ” and manipulating its development to transform it into specific tissues would amount to killing it .	argument
2023	The representative of Canada , emphasizing that his country ’s position was clear , said reproductive cloning was illegal in Canada in whatever form .	argument

2027	It is a process of replication of genetic constitution , so preventing gene diversity .	argument
2028	Genetic modification involves daunting scientific and technical challenges ; it offers the potential of only marginal improvements in complex traits , and it holds out the risk of unpredictable side effects and consequences .	argument
2029	By genetically engineering our species , however , we will be having a detrimental effect on our genetic diversity in the same way as something like cloning would .	argument
2030	It has the ability to completely transform and alter the way that many diseases and disorders are treated .	argument
2031	It is a human experiment doomed to failure because the child will NOT be identical in every way , despite the hopes of the parents .	argument
2032	Unlike cloning-to-produce-children , which would be pursued only by those with a distorted understanding of the goods of procreation and family , cloning-for-biomedical-research serves a noble aim — the discovery of new knowledge that might make possible new modes of healing .	argument
2033	It is unclear how , exactly , the asexual nature of the process , on its own , is problematic from the perspective of human dignity .	argument
2034	Creating stem cells from a cloned embryo presumably would create tissues that would n't be rejected by the person who donated skin cells initially .	argument

2039	This could lead to a set of problems that we have no ability to handle .	argument
2040	Rather , the intent is to use the cells of the embryo in order to further research that may ultimately lead to treatments or cures for certain afflictions .	argument
2041	However , Americans do seem to favor cloning that creates human cells to aid in medical research for disease treatment , just so long as it does not create new human beings .	argument
2042	So when Martha Nussbaum and others note that there are many activities that are commonly thought to be disgusting but that are nonetheless morally acceptable , this has little bearing on whether a sense of repugnance should be taken seriously , because while colonoscopies may commonly be considered disgusting , no one finds them repugnant .	argument
2043	Therapeutic cloning may remain in the experimental phase or just as a rare specialization for some time .	argument
2044	If we engage in cloning , this objection goes , we run the risk of inserting our will too much into our procreative decisions ; we would get to choose not just to have a child , but what kind of child to have .	argument
2045	With our No Pet Cloning campaign , AAVS seeks to protect both animals and people from harm and exploitation .	argument
2046	"Creating better humans through cloning is a good thing "" Why cloning people is a good idea "" ."	argument
2047	Failure of Human Cloning Others that are opposed to human cloning feel that it is a mute debate since human cloning is primarily unsuccessful .	argument
2048	The debate over cloning-to-produce-children is chiefly a debate about a moral vision of the family that is increasingly widely held , one in which reproduction is seen as a freely chosen project of autonomous adults .	argument
2049	When a couple engages in sexual intercourse and produces a baby , the child is an “ offspring of a man and woman , but a replication of neither ; their offspring but not their product whose meaning and destiny they might determine ” ( Meilaender , 1997 , 42 ) .	argument
2050	But there are more realistic , and less obviously unethical , applications of cloning to create genetically matched cells and tissues .	argument
2051	By contrast , there are only minor differences among these groups ' support for human cloning , with more than 80 % of the religious as well as the non-religious opposed to it .	argument
2052	To cite just a few examples , some commentators have suggested that the visceral reaction that many in the public have had to the idea of human reproductive cloning is , from a policy perspective , significant enough to justify , on its own , a regulatory response .	argument
2053	Man would be playing God and create people that are unable to feel and empathize .	argument
2054	The problems with genetic engineering going too far are and ever present worry in a world in which genetic engineering is progressing further and further every day .	argument
2055	On one version of the approach , this would , in turn , set us upon a path to unequivocally horrible social outcomes .	argument
2056	Those being born today can still have their stem cells preserved but those who are already adults did not have such a facility and the quantum of stem cells available in an adult body is not always sufficient enough for therapeutic cloning .	argument
2057	Opinion polling on this issue shows widespread public opposition to human cloning , with roughly nine in 10 Americans against it .	argument
2058	There was still unanimity that reproductive cloning should be banned .	argument
2059	If this objection is successful , if recreating a pre-existing genetic code is intrinsically morally objectionable , then it would seem to present an objection to the actual cloning process .	argument
2060	Reproductive cloning is considered unsafe .	argument
2061	Cloning does not necessarily entail the creation of “ designer ” children because cloning recreates a pre-existing DNA ; it does not involve modifying or enhancing DNA in order to produce a child with certain desired traits .	argument
2062	We already play god ; curing diseases , hospitals , reviving people who die of heart attacks , implanting embryos , etc .	argument
2063	i think if a person is unable to give birth to a baby but they want to have a baby then also cloning is not the right way to have a baby.they can adopt a baby from orphenage if they really want baby in their life .	argument
2064	With continued research , it may be possible to create identically similar animals , or even humans !	argument
2065	There are so many people in the world that to do so is not possible .	argument
2066	But the direct aim of creating human lives in cloning-for-biomedical-research is the destruction of those lives , and the transformation of their bodies into biomedical research supplies .	argument
2067	Using the nonidentity problem in the context of the reproductive cloning debate yields the following result : The alternative to being born a clone is not to be born at all .	argument
2068	With the dignity of human life and it genetic uniqueness at risk , people might be cloned unwillingly , leaving millions of cells around every day as they go about their normal lives shedding skin .	argument
2069	A clone would have access to a tremendous amount of information about his or her parent that could greatly help in understanding one 's psyche and physical attributes .	argument
2070	This is the very reason given in the novel Brave New World : the fictional society ’s cloning-like technology “ is one of the major instruments of social stability !	argument
2071	Though the possible medical benefits of cloning humans are still not fully known , it is argued that such a technology can completely transform the ways by which many disorders are being performed .	argument
2072	It could create new divisions in society where people who are perfectly cloned would be compared to people who were imperfectly cloned or children who were born naturally .	argument
2073	The resulting embryonic stem cells could then theoretically be grown into adult cells to replace the ailing person 's mutated cells .	argument
2074	To take a step towards immortality - Human cloning essentially means taking a human being 's DNA and reversing its age back to zero .	argument
2075	We humans are an amazingly resourceful species , but while this helped us to survive all sorts of devastations in the past we should stop at a certain point .	argument
2076	Such a prospect raises concerns that cloning would facilitate viewing the resulting children as objects of manufacture , rather than as individuals with value and dignity of their own .	argument
2077	At the deepest level , cloning should be prohibited because it turns procreation into a species of manufacture .	argument
2078	Our genome plays a key role in how we develop , but it is hardly determinative of who we are as individuals .	argument
2079	And if they get in trouble with the law , you may be the one who gets blamed even though you did n't do the crime .	argument
2080	One of the main benefit of genetic engineering is that it can help cure and diseases and illness in unborn children .	argument
2081	Dolly the sheep died in 2003 after having been euthanized due to her suffering from pulmonary adenomatosis , a disease fairly common in sheep that are kept indoors ; indeed , many members of Dolly ’s flock had succumbed to the same disease .	argument
2082	For another , a lot of evidence show that most of the cloned babies are not healthy , leading to genetic defects , premature aging and worse , death .	argument
2083	Lastly , proponents of this objection ignore the very important role that nurture has in shaping a person ’s identity .	argument
2084	The identity argument is not an argument against cloning ; rather it is an argument against placing unnecessary and unwarranted pressure on an individual , regardless of how they were conceived .	argument
2085	The medical risks posed by cloning are well known , and the first experimental uses of cloning would pose unjustifiable risks to the children created .	argument
2086	Reproductive cloning can put people ’s lives in danger .	argument
2087	I also do n't know one person that is going to spend the money that it costs to clone an animal just to butcher it .	argument
2088	Animal cloning has been possible since Dolly the sheep was born in 1996 , but human cloning has long been considered nearly as impossible as it is unethical .	argument
2089	Diseases and disorders can be cured .	argument
2090	In doing so , we run the risk of relegating children to the status of mere possessions or commodities , rather than regarding them as beings with their own intrinsic worth ( Harakas , 1998 ; Kass , 1998 ; Meilaender , 1997 ) .	argument
2091	Since the idea of human cloning came out , cloning techniques have been continuously developed , taking basic understanding of developmental human biology to many different levels .	argument
2092	However , there is a more serious , less cartoonish objection to turning procreation into manufacturing .	argument
2093	Opponents of the cloning say that this technology questions God ’s role and existence .	argument
2094	Rather , in this paper I argue that the lack of thoughtful policy analysis of the role of human dignity hurts the broader public debate about reproductive cloning , trivializes the potential value of human dignity as a normative principle and makes it nearly impossible to critique the actual justifications behind many of the proposed policies .	argument
2095	The new moral image of the family , based on a doctrine of reproductive liberty , is an appealing one for a liberal society .	argument
2096	Taken together , the arguments against cloning seem to outweigh any good that could be obtained from the process .	argument
2097	Cloning takes the moral problems associated with these technologies much further .	argument
2098	Even organ cloning would be incredibly helpful to humans as a species , if you could clone healthy heart or liver cells and implant them into the heart or liver of the person who gave the healthy , but needed the cloned ones to cure a disease or just an injury , they could live longer , because of a few cloned cells .	argument
2099	If this proves true , therapeutic tissues could be developed from existing embryonic stem cell lines rather than from cell lines customized for a particular patient .	argument
2100	But the difference between cloned children and twins is not in the information that the clone might receive about his genetic traits , but in the ways that the act of cloning will shape the expectations surrounding his life , especially the expectations of his parents .	argument
2101	Animals who are endangered can be cloned to save their species .	argument
2102	When the clone finishes you could get rid of them ( kill them ) so then history is n't changed that much .	argument
2103	The Washington-based Family Research Council , a conservative think tank and lobbying group , opposes all cloning regardless of its purpose .	argument
2104	Pluripotent stem cells can also be used to test drug toxicity which could also diminish the chances of drug-related birth defects ( Boiani and Schöler , 2002 , 124 ) .	argument
2105	In this paper , I briefly explore one of the most commonly used ethical justifications for cloning laws , the idea that reproductive cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity .	argument
2106	This would also help to fill in the blanks in the theory of evolution .	argument
2107	With cloning , there is a real possibility that humans would become more of a commodity than an individual .	argument
2108	Religious Freedom - At least two religions , the Raelian Religion and the Summum Religion , believe in cloning as one of their tenets .	argument
2109	It is difficult to understand why the act of sexual intercourse that leads to sexual procreation is any more ‘ dignified ’ or respectable than a reasoned decision by an adult to have a child , that is assisted by modern science .	argument
2110	Finally , these kind of instrumentalist concerns assume that cloning would always be done for instrumentalist purposes , which may not be the case ( e.g. , individuals may simply wish to use cloning for the same reason people use IVF , for the purpose of having biologically related offspring ) .	argument
2111	Response 3 : Clones would not be loveless creations .	argument
2112	This means that human DNA is put at risk during the human cloning process .	argument
2113	Thus , there is no fear of rejection of the organ or tissue replacement procedures .	argument
2114	It aids in faster recovery from traumatic injuries .	argument
2115	These are a few examples of how cloning may provide a genetically related child to a person otherwise unable to have one .	argument
2116	Agriculture and Drug Production : Not only can the best traits be perpetuated but farm animals could also be used as ï ¿ ½ machinesï ¿ ½ for large-scale production of medically important proteins .	argument
2117	But if one 's genetic make up is not a key feature to our autonomy and moral thought , and few could genuinely claim that it is , then a central plank of this concern is lost .	argument
2118	just image if someone came up to you and asked you who the father is , and you would have to say noone , just image how painful that would be for you just to say .	argument
2119	As far as humans go , I do n't think it is okay to clone somebody else .	argument
2120	Since then , scientists have moved on to use more ethical methods for stem cell research , such as iPS .	argument
2121	For example , Martha Nussbaum mentions “ open heart surgeries and colonoscopies ” as examples of actions commonly thought to be disgusting but nonetheless morally acceptable .	argument

2349	If cloning could be perfected and used for this limited group , it would be all but impossible to prevent its use from spreading .	argument
2350	It was for this reason that , for a long time , creating a cloned embryo from adult somatic cells was thought to be impossible – it would require taking long-time differentiated cells and getting them to behave like the totipotent cells ( cells that are able to differentiate into any cell type , including the ability to form an entirely distinct organism ) found in newly fertilized eggs .	argument

2434	The research was done to provide a possible surgical procedure to make quadriplegics mobile once again .	argument
2435	Robertson concedes this objection , but he responds that “ if a ban on cloning is justified , then a ban on many other forms of assisted reproduction and genetic selection should be as well , yet few persons are prepared to go that far ” ( 2006 , 206 ) .	argument

2467	Reproductive cloning has the potential to replace sperm donation , IVF or surrogacy .	argument
2468	This concern is with how cloning would bring children into the world ( that is , by manufacturing ) not with what the cloned children will be ( that is , artifacts ) .	argument

2511	Biomedical Research : Cloning can produce genetically identical laboratory animals which can be used as models for human disease .	argument
2512	Cloning would replace the attitude of unconditional parental love and acceptance with one of mastery , transforming the family into an arrangement ordered toward satisfying the desires of adults at the expense of the interests of children , rather than an institution meant to subordinate the desires of adults to the interests of children .	argument
2513	If the films were to be believed , a person ’s clone could turn out to be a person ’s dark side .	argument
2514	Though this student is right that IVF poses some serious dangers to women and children , these risks are hardly good reasons to use human cloning , since any remotely plausible cloning technology would involve the same risks to the mother , and would almost certainly pose more serious risks to the future child .	argument
2515	When a child is cloned to produce matching tissues that can be used to treat a particular health condition , then human cloning would be the next best thing to the discovery of technologies that has forever changed human life .	argument
2516	Animals like the Wooly Mammoth , Tasmanian Tiger , and yes , even dinosaurs , could once again roam the earth .	argument
2517	They include the following potential health benefits : - the possibility of cloning technology to learn to renew activity damaged tissues and grow new cells to replace them ; - people 's ability to create genetically identical to donor organs such as : kidney , bone marrow transplant ; - the benefit of studying cell differentiation at the same time as the study and development of cloning ; - sterile couples will be able to have children who will have the genetic information of the mother or the father 's .	argument
2518	Cloning , on the other hand , would not require certain and specific knowledge about particular genes , it would only require identifying an exceptionally intelligent individual and replicating his or her genome .	argument
2519	There are concerns that cloned humans would lack individuality , that they would be treated in undignified ways by their creators , or that they would be damaged by society ’s expectations that they should be more like those from whom they were cloned .	argument
2520	With genetic engineering , on the other hand , we could reverse some of the most basic reasons for the body ’s natural decline on a cellular level , drastically improving both the span of our lives and the quality of life later on .	argument
2521	Since , presumably , a clone would still be a person and an autonomous rational being , a clone would certainly retain her human dignity ( Glannon , 2005 ; Elliot , 1998 ) .	argument
2522	There are many diseases that can be prevented or at least controlled with the help of therapeutic cloning .	argument
2523	Reproductive cloning would foster an understanding of children , and of people in general , as objects that can be designed and manufactured to possess specific characteristics .	argument

2525	Dan Brock further supports the contention that cloning in order to replace a deceased child is misguided ( Brock , 1997 ) .	argument
2526	The claim is that a cloned child would be in danger of suffering from severe genetic defects as a result of being a clone , or that cloning would result in a high number of severely defective embryos before one healthy human embryo is developed .	argument
2527	Some would argue that a cloned child is a means to an end .	argument
2528	More importantly , given Meilaender ’s concern that the quality of parenting is compromised in tandem with the artificiality of conception , the study found that “ the quality of parenting in families with a child conceived by assisted conception is superior to that shown by families with a naturally conceived child , even when gamete donation is used in the child 's conception ” ( Golombok et al. , 1995 , 295 ; also see Golombok , 2003 and Golombok et al. , 2001 ) .	argument
2529	For example , a couple may be able to generate only a few embryos from IVF procedures ; cloning via artificially induced twinning would increase the number of embryos to a quantity that is more likely to result in a live birth .	argument
2530	I do not agree with the sentence that states that it is repugnant to use fertilized embryos .	argument
2531	One reason is that there are some advocates — both academics and activists — who have been arguing for the use of cloning to produce children , and while they are still in the minority , that may change .	argument
2532	When parents do not like the children they have got , then they would just go clone another one in the hopes of getting it perfect the next time around .	argument
2533	Moreover , because parents have cloned this child with the expressed purpose of replacing a deceased child , the expectations that the new child will be just like the deceased one would be overwhelming and impede the child ’s ability to develop her own individuality ( Levick , 2004 ) .	argument
2534	Yet , we can look towards the children who are products of modern day artificial reproduction in order to see that such a concern is not supported by the evidence .	argument

2676	Studying regeneration of organs , solutions to conditions like diabetes and Parkinson ’s are becoming a realm of possibility with the help of therapeutic cloning .	argument
2677	Unlike identical twins , who grow up simultaneously , the cloned child ’s elder “ twin ” will stand as a kind of genetic prophecy , and a source of expectations for how the younger child ’s life might turn out , even in the unlikely event that those expectations had nothing to do with the choice to produce a clone in the first place .	argument
2678	Only 1 % of animal cloning made so far have had a positive result , but most of them have suffered serious disorders .	argument
2679	Religious beliefs are the main reason for opposition to cloning , according to a February 2001 Time/CNN poll .	argument

2746	Opponents firmly believe that bringing back a species that has been gone for thousands of years is playing God , and nothing good will come from the practice .	argument
2747	If someone is hurting over a death , they can reproduce the child .	argument
2748	Eugene Volokh , a professor at the UCLA School of Law , puts it this way : “ Scientists should generally have the freedom to experiment , people should generally have the freedom to have important life-saving technologies , and parents should generally have the freedom to make their children 's lives better , unless [ cloning is shown to ] cause serious , tangible harm . ”	argument
2749	Moreover , every time that a doctor performs life-saving surgery or administers drugs he is changing the destiny of the patient and could be thus seen as usurping the role of God .	argument
2750	But while it is important that we prohibit cloning-to-produce-children to prevent the long-term degradation of the family , we can not do so without also making a strong case against the much more immediate threat posed by cloning-for-biomedical-research .	argument
2751	The predominate theme underlying arguments against human cloning is that the cloned child would undergo some sort of physical , social , mental , or emotional harm .	argument
2752	A Child 's right to be better than its parents - It 's been suggested that parents have a duty to see that their children have better lives than they do .	argument
2753	Several scientists dismissed that argument , saying that it remains impossible to clone a baby .	argument
2754	""" From the mouse data , we know that [ embryonic cloning ] is better than iPS cells , "" Cibelli said ."	argument
2755	""" Replacing "" the deceased child by cloning degrades and dehumanizes the child , its replacement , and all of us ."	argument
2756	Still , the industry is continuously developing and the future creations are quite promising .	argument
2757	John A. Robertson points to a number of circumstances under which parents might seek to clone one of their minor children , including the desire for a “ second child like the first ” or one “ who could be a source of tissue or organs ” or a second child “ to replace a dead or dying child with one with its genes . ”	argument
2758	If genes are modified to create beings who are smarter than others , the average person will not have a place in society .	argument
2759	What if we start demanding ‘ designer babies ’ , children whose hair color , eye color , height and intelligence we ourselves dictate ?	argument
2760	Using their own cells , they would be given the chance to truly heal with less complications .	argument
2761	And the fact that IVF has proven safe proves neither that the original IVF experiments were ethical ( they were not ) nor that the success of the IVF experiments provides ethical justification for proceeding with human cloning experiments ( it does not ) .	argument
2762	"Cloning evil people will not result in evil clones "" Why cloning people is a good idea "" ."	argument
2763	Just the research of human cloning alone could save a great many lives .	argument
2764	Some have argued the opposing side , however , and have maintained that respect for procreative liberty not only entails access to artificial reproductive technology , but also the right to employ gamete donors and surrogate mothers ( Ethics Committee of the American Fertility Society , 1985 ) .	argument
2765	It was unfortunate that that initiative was hijacked , and culminated today in the adoption of a text which sought to impose a single set of regulations on States regarding all forms of human cloning .	argument
2766	One response typically given by philosophers when concerning the ethics of preconception decisions that may lead to the birth of a disabled child involves an appeal to Derek Parfit ’s nonidentity problem ( Parfit , 1984 , though Parfit himself does not apply this to cloning ) .	argument
2767	The first IVF experiments could not be carried out ethically , he warned , since “ the unmade child has not ‘ volunteered ’ to help the scientist . ”	argument
2768	Even if a cloned child may live longer , it could be infected with certain diseases or might be too fragile .	argument
2769	Say he became quadriplegic , Scientists have said that there is a possibility that new spinal cord cells can be made and walking again is an option .	argument
2770	Human cloning creates questions about the soul , the role of God in society , and even the quality of life that a cloned person would have .	argument
2771	Moreover , Ian Wilmut and other commentators have noted that we can not know whether clones will suffer from premature ageing as a result of their elderly genes .	argument
2772	Some people will owe their lives to this technology , and some infertile couples will be grateful for having had the chance to raise a child of their own .	argument
2773	And surely we would hold that these diseases and birth defects were bad for the children .	argument
2774	But when made through technologically mediated processes , children can be seen by parents and doctors as products to be shaped and controlled , accepted or rejected .	argument
2775	A person suffering from cellular degeneration can have the problem resolved .	argument
2776	And from the point of view of parents who want children who can checkmate like Kasparov , belt like Aretha , dunk like Dr. J , or bend it like Beckham , cloning could represent a way to have offspring with the exceptional abilities of these individuals .	argument
2777	Because clone cells may show genetic abnormalities , using them on humans will also have a deadly implication .	argument
2778	Cloning would prove every religion wrong and say god or whoever it is is not the sout create of life god would cease to exist and the world would turn to turmoil .	argument
2779	Such a lax standard denies us the most compelling and obvious reasons for condemning experiments that are clearly unethical .	argument
2780	This is a question which appears to be entirely lost on Kass , since he completely ignores the question of presumption and jumps into giving a series of ultimately flawed reasons against human cloning .	argument
2781	If a particular type of reproductive technology poses a health risk to the resulting children , this is grounds enough to prevent the use of that technology ( Cohen , 1996 ) .	argument
2782	Curing Diseases : The growing scientific field known as regenerative medicine , also known as therapeutic cloning , is allowing thousands of lives to be saved from cloning human cells , tissues , and even organs .	argument
2783	Identical twins , as natural clones , do n’t seem to have identity problems , and if they did , a ban on them is not the answer .	argument
2784	With human cloning on the rise , it is greatly possible that human beings would become more of a commodity than an individual .	argument
2785	These individual stem cells hold great promise for the treatment and cures of life threatening diseases and illnesses , such as cancer , Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s , diabetes , ALS and spinal cord injury .	argument
2786	But cloning technologies are needed if inheritable genetic modification is to become commercially practicable .	argument
2787	By contrast , the expression “ therapeutic cloning ” refers to the creation of human embryos by SCNT for some other purpose , such as for biomedical research or for harvesting cells or tissues to be used in therapies .	argument
2788	Another fear exists if people decide to genetically engineer super kids .	argument
2789	Reproductive cloning could allow parents of a child who has died to seek redress for their loss .	argument
2790	It will cause problems we would end up using it for warfare sothen other countries would use it for warfare wich would be chaos it is already bad enough all of the war we have now .	argument
2791	Third , embryos can also be used in stem cell research , and thus possibly save human lives .	argument
2792	The conclusion of experts is that the current level of technology , human cloning is very dangerous .	argument
2793	We should n't use clones to replace a dead family member , friend , or spouse because then there could be an out break and the clones could start pointless wars and arguments .	argument
2794	That is defying the rules of god .	argument
2795	She quotes some of the Council ’s discussion about how cloning could result in family relations that “ would differ from all existing family arrangements ” because of the “ unique , one-sided , and replicative biological connection to only one progenitor ” — but she then badly mischaracterizes that discussion : “ This is another way of saying that the technology is unnatural and leads to unnatural results . ”	argument
2796	To make a future couple financially secure - With human cloning you could give a couple in the future both a child from your DNA and the financial assets from your lifetime to start out financially secure instead of struggling as most couples do now .	argument
2797	Reproductive cloning is inherently unsafe .	argument
2798	Those who fail to begin research right away will fall behind .	argument
2799	Human life is believed to be precious and sacred .	argument
2800	Besides the religious arguments , however , there are a number of ethic objections .	argument
2801	The basis for this justification is that reproductive human cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity .	argument
2802	Moreover , those who have made significant contributions to science , the arts , music and literature would be ideally cloned to produce more of them to contribute more of their works .	argument
2803	( b ) There is no medical need for cloning .	argument
2804	QUIT CLONING TO SAVE LIVES .	argument
2805	When we consider cloning , we must not blindly overlook its negative implications .	argument
2806	Many philosophers and ethicists who would otherwise support reproductive cloning concede that concern for the safety of children born via cloning is reason to caution against its use ( Harris , 2004 ; Glannon , 2005 ) .	argument
2807	Cloning techniques will eventually be perfected in mammals and will then be suitable for human trials .	argument
2808	However , whereas in the objection from the Right to an Open Future , the cloned child is deprived of individuality based on the perception of others ( and , as is developed above , this does not seem to really be an objection to the practice of cloning simpliciter ) , this objection indicates that there is something inherently individuality-compromising , and therefore dignity-compromising , in recreating an existing genetic code .	argument
2809	Nevertheless , they do not connect this analysis to the issue of human dignity and both conclude that reproductive cloning still creates problems in relation to individual autonomy .	argument
2810	The ethos that underlies these positions is , of course , both scientifically inaccurate and philosophically problematic .	argument
2811	With cloning-to-produce-children for the sake of eugenic enhancement , parents ( that is , the individuals who choose to commission the production of a cloned child ) will need to be concerned not with their genetic relationship to their children , but only with the child ’s genetic and biological properties .	argument
2812	As a result , many humans will all look alike .	argument
2813	Egg collection procedures pose health risks to women , and the practice of paying women for their eggs could lead to exploitation of those who might feel pressured to subject themselves to risk .	argument
2814	But few people , outside a handful of professional bioethicists , believe that autonomous choice and rational control are all there is to the family .	argument
2815	Our experience of identical twins shows that individuals with identical genomes are capable of forming their own life plans , their own senses of who they are , and all the rest of the complex psychological and social desiderata that constitute personal identity .	argument
2816	When people are able to clone themselves they will be able to choose which type of person shall be born .	argument
2817	By exercising this kind of control over the genetic ancestry and the genetic properties of children , cloning would undermine parents ’ openness toward what is novel in the next generation .	argument
2818	Of course , it is possible that cloning could be used in conjunction with genetic modification , by allowing scientists to perform extensive genetic manipulations of somatic cells before transferring them to oocytes .	argument
2819	Though a human clone would undoubtedly be a brand new life with unique preferences , there would still be a potential loss of individuality because a clone is simply a twin of someone else , no matter what the age of that other person may be .	argument
2820	They see cloning as a route towards a Brave New World of human genetic engineering .	argument
2821	Some ethicists fear the clones rights will be broken .	argument
2822	Human Rights : A lot of people worry that cloned people would not have full rights , since they are just copies .	argument
2823	It might be used for exploitation .	argument
2824	The first children to be cloned would be in no position to consent to being research subjects for the experimental use of a new technology .	argument
2825	Therapeutic cloning could provide unique ways to cure diseases until now considered incurable : diabetes , Parkinson 's , Alzheimer 's , heart disease .	argument
2826	The anti-cloners made the case for stem cell research while alleging that cloning itself would not result in any major scientific breakthroughs .	argument
2827	The creation of identical copies of animals – through cloning , it is possible to create genetically identical animals for organ or tissue transplantation ; and the creation of identical copies of only the best animal population 2 .	argument
2828	It may reduce the overall value of human life .	argument
2829	This can be done naturally ( i.e. , twins ) or using technology with plants and animals .	argument
2830	Seeing the way that their bodies are structured and function would help us to better decipher the state of the earth before they became extinct .	argument
2831	This will only cause further problems in the world .	argument
2832	In general , notions that the cloning of individuals , possibly at the same rate as for IVF , would decrease genetic diversity in a global population of six billion people , is an exaggerated and spurious claim .	argument
2833	So maybe actually cloning a human or possibly super humans might not be the best for the world today but great medical advantages can come if cloning is not banned and further research is allowed .	argument
2834	But for people seeking to give their child the best chance at having exceptional intelligence , cloning may at least seem to offer more control and predictability than gene modification , and cloning is more consistent with our limited understanding of the science of genetics .	argument
2835	The research would give great insights about the basics of the body .	argument
2836	Similar issues could arise for cloned domesticated animals , particularly if they fully replaced animals that created genetic variation through normal breeding methods .	argument
2837	"if we have "" perfect "" people , then why do we even need to have people at all ?"	argument
2838	The thousands of children given life through IVF therapy do not suffer a lack of dignity as a consequence of their method of procreation .	argument
2839	Most scientists argue against reproductive human cloning on the grounds that it is not safe .	argument
2840	Additionally , if the reason people treat cloned children unfavorably is due to their misconceptions about cloning , then the proper response is not to ban cloning at the expense of compromising procreative liberty , but rather work to rectify these prejudices and misconceptions ( Burley and Harris , 1999 ) .	argument
2841	Wide-spread cloning would exacerbate the problem by distorting generational boundaries , which would add a layer of confusion to society ’s conception of the nature of the family , and the roles of its individual members ( Kass , 1998 ) .	argument
2842	Who 's to say we do n't deserve the chance to have a clone of ourselves , imagine all the things they could help us with !	argument
2843	This weakness may also , however , make cloning more appealing than other forms of genetic engineering , especially when we consider the genetic complexity of many desirable traits .	argument
2844	However , this misconception may quickly be rectified simply by observing the unique personality of the cloned child , especially since her experiences and her nurture , removed by at least a generation , will be substantially different than that of her genetic predecessor ( Dawkins , 1998 ; Pence , 1998 ) .	argument
2845	Procreative liberty is a right well established in Western political culture ( Dworkin , 1994 ) .	argument
2846	It could eliminate defective genes .	argument
2847	Bone marrow transplantation may be the only form of stem cell therapy used to date , but it wo n’t be long before this type of treatment can be used to cure diabetes , spinal cord injury , or heart disease .	argument
2848	Early death or premature aging – when somatic cells undergo telomeric shortening during cloning , the results can be early death of the animal or premature aging 4 .	argument
2849	Another way of explaining it is that creating a child solely for the purposes of providing life-saving aid for another child violates Immanuel Kant ’s second principle formulation of the categorical imperative .	argument
2850	But if cloning is going to be used for a good purpose , then it can help improve humanity , as it can help cure incurable diseases .	argument
2851	One huge reason will be that the child will be brought up in a highly abnormal household : one where grief has been diverted into makeing a clone instead of adjusting to loss .	argument
2852	It is baseless that a dictator would build an army of clones Nathan Myhrvold .	argument
2853	Callahan argues that there is something intrinsically identity-depriving , and therefore dignity-depriving , in duplicating a genetic code .	argument
2854	The science may make humans more of a commodity , which would place less value on each human life .	argument
2855	That a cloned child will have essentially only a single genetic ancestor is at the heart of the moral meaning of cloning-to-produce-children .	argument
2856	By cloning them and bringing them back into existence , we are offering them and us a second chance to live together in harmony .	argument
2857	there could be so many things that could go wrong , they , just like any other man made thing , could have several problems , physco running clones isnt really what i dream about at night .	argument
2858	It is hard to say whether this is true , but we have seen devastating consequences of other research-programs , even with good intentions , such as nuclear research .	argument
2859	Surely it is preferable for a mother to know the genetic heritage of her offspring , rather than accept sperm from an unknown and random donor ?	argument
2860	This would provide an ideal projectile for splitting the nucleus of the atom .	argument
2861	The fact that stem cell therapy was made possible because of cloning techniques speaks volumes of the potential of the technology to cure a wide range of diseases .	argument
2862	"The cloning of a monkey or other non-human primate would likely be a "" strong signal "" that it 's time to set some rules around human cloning , Cibelli said ."	argument
2863	Another common concern is that cloning is morally wrong because it oversteps the boundaries of humans ’ role in scientific research and development .	argument
2864	Some science fiction writers have speculated that extinct members of the genus Homo , such as Neanderthals , could be revived through cloning .	argument
2865	"Weigh things first , if cloning has more advantages than cons , then maybe it only means we have to go for it . """	argument
2866	Human beings are not simply genes and molecules .	argument
2867	"Opposition to cloning is n't just Luddism -- it 's racism . """	argument
2868	While I believe that pre-determining the sex of a child is not applicable in modern society , I find no logically moral reasons why this should be banned .	argument
2869	But one of the arguments that people have against artificial cloning is that people are trying to play God by creating life in unnatural ways .	argument
2870	The philosopher Hilary Putnam offered a useful analysis of the role of strong moral reactions against cloning in a 1999 lecture , in which he argued that the strong and immediate moral condemnation of human cloning was justified , even though the grounds for this condemnation could not be “ easily derived from already-codified moral doctrines . ”	argument
2871	Some people feel great reluctance to eat cloned meat , which might lower the value of animals that are cloned .	argument
2872	( Even so , suppose you were a slightly deformed human clone - would you agree that it was a terrible moral offense to have caused you to come into existence ? )	argument
2873	Bringing these animals back could have wonderful effects on the environment .	argument
2874	Embryonic stem cells appear less likely to stimulate rejection after transplantation than other cell types .	argument
2875	We have no idea how it would impact the animals that are still here today , or what effects it would have on the environment .	argument
2876	Legalize human cloning is in the heart of the debate world , was proposed legalizing therapeutic cloning as the only way to investigate , with chances of success , the basic criterion for funding such programs as the main objective being to find treatments for incurable diseases .	argument
2877	These fictional societies , in which the most basic notions of human rights are abandoned , can easily be dismissed as highly unrealistic .	argument
2878	If society wishes to ban inheritable genetic modification it can and should do so .	argument
2879	""" A life is a life and that should never be compromised ."	argument
2880	However , what is to stop just a handful of people taking the research too far ?	argument
2881	In vitro fertilisation remains an imperfect technology .	argument
2882	Transferring a cloned cow embryo into a cow uterus results in a healthy calf less than 10 percent of the time , Cibelli told LiveScience .	argument
2883	There is no way of knowing how children will react to having such a confused genetic heritage .	argument
2884	Tis would cause premature aging issues and potentially lead to premature death .	argument
2885	As Professor Savulescu so neatly counters , ‘ to say that creating a clone is an affront to human dignity is like saying that deliberately creating a black person , or a woman , affronts human dignity .	argument
2886	The success rate of genetic experiments leaves a lot to be desired , after all .	argument
2887	Would the same advocates of this objection against cloning object to artificial insulin injections to treat diabetes ?	argument
2888	Parents that have lost a child can have that child returned to them with a clone .	argument
2889	"Yet , according to an article on the Veterinary Information Network , Inc. , "" Hawthorne 's mother , who was the original owner of Missy , says the clones have very different temperaments from the original ."	argument
2890	Philosophy professor Allen E. Buchanan , for instance , argues that ethicists like Kass “ insinuate that the only reasons most people have for producing a human by cloning are unseemly — for example , to act out a sick fantasy of recreating their dead child from the DNA in a strand of hair or to indulge in their narcissism . ”	argument
2891	If it helps more than it harms , can it really be that bad ?	argument
2892	"Other recent research suggests that it may eventually be possible to achieve similar results by "" reprogramming "" some of the patient 's own cells ."	argument
2893	The most basic of all is that it involves killing a potential human being .	argument
2894	Humans are not set for the role of controlling nature and genetics in a godly like position .	argument
2895	One of these is the fact that we may be able to bring back animals that have been long extinct !	argument
2896	You can not have so-called therapeutic cloning without reproductive cloning because the technique to make cloned babies is the same as to make a cloned embryo to try to make replacement tissues .	argument
2897	"i think that the human race has so many issues with our teens and children today , that we need to work with what we have now , not neglect it , and be trying to create a "" better "" human ."	argument
2898	Treatment for Human Disease : Cells could be harvested from early embryos to provide cell and tissue replacement without the hazards of transplantation rejection .	argument
2899	Women dispose of fertilized eggs during their menstrual cycle more often than they are aware ; one study claims that as many as 73 % of fertilized eggs do not survive to 6 weeks gestation ( Boklage , 1990 ) .	argument
2900	This reason is self defeating ; because as scientists learn more , cloning humans has the possibility of becoming safer than naturally developing embryos by replacing randomized risks and genetic defects .	argument
2901	He hoped the funding for research into human cloning could be redirected towards research and development to find cures for those affected by HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .	argument
2902	"A coalition of states , including Spain , Italy , Philippines , USA , Costa Rica and the "" Holy Land "" have tried to expand the debate on all forms of human cloning , noting that in their view , therapeutic cloning violates human dignity ."	argument
2903	Response 2 : A child is not replaceable .	argument
2904	A cloned cow recently died several weeks after birth with a huge abnormality of blood cell production .	argument
2905	If we are able to create clones , then god must have meant for it to be possible .	argument
2906	In our full report , we show what is at stake in the debate over cloning-for-biomedical-research , and why it is important to reject human cloning whatever its purpose is .	argument
2907	The representatives of the Netherlands said his country had opposed the Declaration because it could be interpreted as a total ban on all forms of cloning .	argument
2908	The “ genetic parents ” of a cloned child in this sense could be dead decades before their child is conceived , and the biological connection between them and their new genetic child will be completely mediated by another individual , namely , their child , the person whose genome has been replicated .	argument
2909	One advantage to doing this is that the later born twin could serve as a blood or bone marrow donor for her older sibling should the need arise ; because they are genetically identical , the match would be guaranteed ( the converse could also hold , that is , the older individual could serve as a donor for the clone should the latter ever need it .	argument
2910	However , there is a possibility that the age of the donor could be imprinted on the growing embryo .	argument
2911	Even more than other reproductive technologies , cloning would involve children being made by doctors and technicians in accordance with the designs and wishes of parents .	argument
2912	For example , while there is no evidence that Dolly ’s respiratory issues were due to her being a clone , questions remain whether her arthritis , which is uncommon among sheep her age , could have resulted because of the nature of her genesis ( Williams , 2003 ) .	argument
2913	Giving all people the ability to have their own children is a huge benefit that human cloning can eventually provide down the line .	argument
2914	The poll also found that 22 % believe that cloning interferes with distinctiveness and individuality , while the same percentage said cloning could be used for questionable purposes .	argument
2915	Cloning is also detrimental to the beauty that comes from diversity .	argument
2916	Test-tube babies , they point out , raised comparable concerns when they were first conceived .	argument
2917	Also , the implications of what happens when the process goes wrong are still not fully understood , which is not good and could lead to problems that we will not be able to handle .	argument
2918	But advocacy groups on opposite ends of the political spectrum said Friday that the study is a reminder of the need for government to step in before someone tries to extend this technique to engineer a human clone .	argument
2919	"You can read about many of the expected medical benefits in the essay "" The Benefits of Human Cloning . """	argument
2920	However , scenarios like this one ( and others involving simple genetic diseases ) seem implausible , because there are other existing technologies that doctors can recommend to achieve the same end — including sperm or egg donation and preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) .	argument
2921	In the realm of genetics , it is far better to be safe than sorry .	argument
2922	Moreover , defective genes could be eliminated with cloning a human ’s body ’s good cells .	argument
2923	And therapeutic cloning is never therapeutic for the cloned embryo , which is destroyed , and is not necessarily therapeutic for any particular patients .	argument
2924	Cloning undermines the natural relationship between procreation and family Pamela Schaeffer .	argument
2925	When that happens , it could create a whole new set of issues that we may not have any knowledge on .	argument
2926	It 's true that iPS cells have great promise .	argument
2927	To ensure that a technique for creating life is safe enough to be ethically justifiable would paradoxically require experiments made under conditions where that knowledge is not available , and such experiments would themselves be unjustifiable : as Ramsey writes , “ we can not morally get to know how to perfect this technique . ”	argument
2928	Others have the potential to repair or replace damaged tissue or cells .	argument
2929	Therapeutic cloning is where cells from a human are cloned for transplant or medicine purposes .	argument
2930	You will not find a child psychiatrist in the world who could possibly say that there will not be very significant emotional risk to the cloned child as a result of these pressures .	argument
2931	And cloning-for-biomedical-research will lay the technical and practical groundwork for cloning-to-produce-children and a number of other morally troubling acts .	argument
2932	The clone is not an exact copy , in spite of sharing DNA with the person from whom he/she was cloned .	argument
2933	Maintaining Biodiversity : Cloning may be an important tool for preserving endangered species if currently practiced methods fail .	argument
2934	it would be good , to a certain extent .	argument
2935	When it comes to infertile couples , should not they be granted the opportunity to produce clones of themselves ?	argument
2936	However , there seems to be a way out of the ethical dilemma posed by cloning-for-biomedical research : the human induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells first developed in 2007 provide a promising alternative that does not rely on the destruction of embryos .	argument
2937	There have been times when majorities have been wrong about what is morally repugnant : xenophobia and racism are often accompanied by a moralistic sense of repugnance , yet we rightly reject them both .	argument
2938	Restricting any sort of medical research is unacceptable .	argument
2939	To cure infertility - Infertile people are discriminated against .	argument
2940	We are god now !	argument
2941	What we are left with , then , is the desire to have a child without a “ partner , ” even an anonymous sperm donor .	argument
2942	More generally , people come to embrace new technologies , even those that initially seemed shocking and “ unnatural ” , once concrete benefits become clear .	argument
2943	The tacit implication here is that cloning is desirable because it somehow presents a way to cheat death .	argument
2944	Second , cloning could allow prospective parents to protect their children from a broad array of diseases known to be associated with genetic risk factors .	argument
2945	"Diseases which have dogged us for generations could be wiped out due to our evolving faster than they could ever hope to . """	argument
2946	It may work wonders but who knows if playing with the nature is “ really safe ” ?	argument
2947	Also , evidence suggests that clones often have built-in genetic defects and are unhealthy , which can lead to premature ageing and even death .	argument
2948	How can they possibly understand the ramifications of slight changes made at the smallest level ?	argument
2949	A child who is created as a “ savior sibling ” may still , also , be loved and respected as an individual in her own right , and therefore may not necessarily be treated solely as a means ( Boyle and Savulescu , 2001 ) .	argument
2950	One common claim is that bringing children into the world in this way is somehow a violation of the natural order , or of human dignity ; or perhaps it would be an act of “ playing God ” .	argument
2951	Embryos at Risk : The process of human cloning increases the risk of harm to embryos and thus to the cloned person throughout their life .	argument
2952	Also , is n't the U.S known for our diversity and our originality in how not one person is the same ?	argument
2953	Any method of procreation that does not implement traditional modes of conception , i.e. , not involving the union of sperm and ova , is guilty of one ( or both ) of these infractions ( Goodman , 2008 ; Tierney , 2007 ) .	argument
2954	Worship your God all you please , but Cloning is the Future and it WILL happen one way or the other .	argument
2955	Besides , many experts believe that there is no clone that is fully healthy .	argument

If you 're rich , you usually do n't meet the death penalty ... I do n't think it 's very good sign for civilization to still be invoking the death penalty .	argument
4602	We have looked at the pain caused by execution but what of the suffering ?	argument
4603	Increasingly , countries and states are banning the death penalty ; drug companies are refusing to allow their products to be used for capital punishment ; the U.S. is executing fewer people ; and public support for the death penalty is waning .	argument
4604	Because the average length of the initial prosecution for a death penalty case -- not including lengthy appeals -- means more than a thousand extra days of courtroom resources are being used .	argument
4605	One can not and should not deny the suffering of the victim 's family in a murder case but the suffering of the murderer 's family is surely valid too .	argument
4606	Ironically , the slight increase in the number of executions in the past few years have robbed them of much dramatic effect .	argument

4639	The first side would argue that the Constitution has made it clear how this country should handle guns and its gun owners .	argument
4640	Such acceptance and compliance , however , WILL NEVER HAPPEN in this country because HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT GUN REGISTRATION ALWAYS LEADS TO GUN CONFISCATION .	argument
4641	To state that a creature , who is willing to violate Malum In Se through the act of murder , robbery , rape , etc. , will be dissuaded from using a firearm during the aforementioned acts by a new Malum Prohibitum statute is the height of childish naivete and blind , emotionally driven foolishness .	argument

4669	If our laws had permitted that , I ’m pretty sure we would ’ve wised up the third or fourth time somebody drove one up to a school , parked in the school bus lane , and started lobbing cannon rounds into the gym , music room , cafeteria , and classrooms — while fending off law enforcement with a rain of fire from its three auxiliary machine guns .	argument
4670	States in the south typically have very lax gun laws and often allow individuals to purchase many weapons , quickly and without a background check .	argument

4684	"Also , recent studies show that states with right-to-carry laws are associated with substantially higher rates "" of aggravated assault , robbery , rape and murder ."	argument

4698	Of course the real reason many Americans “ cling ” to their guns ( to borrow the president ’s language ) has far more to do with common sense than any single organization .	argument
4699	At that point , a “ good guy with a gun ” is only one way to stop him .	argument
4700	It is a terrible irony that the very same gun enthusiasts — many of whom see gun registration to be in infringement on personal liberty and fear an oppressive federal government — wish to impose what they fear onto others .	argument

4715	The issue of gun control is n't even an issue in Britain , as pretty much everyone in the UK is for gun control .	argument

4738	For example , actual “ assault-weapons ” are already largely banned , but control advocates rail against semi-automatic military-style weapons ( these are not actual assault weapons , they just look like them ) despite the fact that long guns of all types are used in an insignificant amount of crime ( less than 1 % of total gun crime ) and that those military-style weapons are generally less lethal than most hunting rifles ( they use smaller-caliber bullets designed to wound on the battlefield rather than the larger , more powerful bullets designed to kill much larger animals ) .	argument

5463	The entire premise of “ gun control ” is stupid , as is the idea of furthering 80 years of increasing restrictions that are effectively meaningless .	argument
5464	Gun control opponents , however , have long argued that the Second Amendment was put in place not just for ordinary home defense against burglars but specifically to guarantee that the nation could never be overcome by any military power foreign or domestic .	argument

5466	Even more worrying , people who committed suicide were found to be seventeen times more likely to live with guns at home than not .	argument

5485	For example , nearly 2/3 of gun deaths are suicides ; conservatives ( currently and likely temporarily ) claim willingness to improve mental health access .	argument
5486	Another problem with background checks is surveys of inmates show overwhelmingly that criminals obtain guns on the black market or the grey market .	argument
5487	Which raises a question : When even anti-gun activists believe that the debate over private gun ownership is closed ; when it is too late to reduce the number of guns in private hands — and since only the naive think that legislation will prevent more than a modest number of the criminally minded , and the mentally deranged , from acquiring a gun in a country absolutely inundated with weapons — could it be that an effective way to combat guns is with more guns ?	argument

5491	Liberals sometimes make the mistake of anthropomorphizing guns , ascribing to them moral characteristics they do not possess .	argument

5493	We ’re living in a time where everything is declared as “ war ” , to erode our rights .	argument
5494	Fewer guns , better records on who has them , and some restrictions on purchase , possession and storage , gun control advocates argue , would still allow law-abiding people to have firearms , while resulting in far fewer deaths .	argument
5495	None of this is to imply that in areas of well-armed civilians , the violent crime rate must go down .	argument
5496	Proponents of more gun control laws argue that the Second Amendment was intended for militias ; that deadly and costly gun violence would be reduced ; and that a majority of Americans , including gun owners , support new gun restrictions .	argument
